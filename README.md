# twitch-overlays

My twitch components & overlays for my stream.

Added routes for each view (waiting/playing) or component (countdown...).

## Vues

### Playing

Contains all the overlays to play a game. Can be either all static or I can do lots of small views that can be integrated to the stream.

### Snack-time !

Countdown (or not) to take a pause while streaming.

### Beginning of the stream

Countdown before stream really begins.

### Ending of the stream

Countdown before stream shutdown.
